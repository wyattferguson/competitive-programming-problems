Name: Large sum
Problem URL: https://projecteuler.net/problem=13
Date Completed: May 2021 
Description: This is an alternative solution that keeps the numbers as strings so they
can be as big as your computer can handle and not limited by the size of an int. 
This was a personal challenge and not the best solution to the problem fyi.
